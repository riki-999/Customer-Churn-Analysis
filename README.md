## Enerygy Price Sensitivity

Powerco is a major gas and electricity utility that supplies corporate, SME (Small & Medium enterprises), and residential customers. The power liberalization of the energy market in Europe has led to significant customer churn, especially in the SME segment. They have partnered with BCG to help diagnose the source of churning SME customers.

A fair hypothesis is that price changes affect customer churn. Therefore, it is helpful to know which customers are more (or less) likely to churn at their current price, for which a good predictive model could be useful.

Client is PowerCo - a major gas and electricity utility that supplies to small and medium sized enterprises.

The energy market has had a lot of change in recent years and there are more options than ever for customers to choose from.
PowerCo are concerned about their customers leaving for better offers from other energy providers. When a customer leaves to use another service provider, this is called churn.
This is becoming a big issue for PowerCo and they have engaged BCG to help diagnose the reason why their customers are churning.

## Associated Methods
1. Log10 Transformation: Reduces skewness and normalizes data by applying the base-10 logarithm.
2. Random Forest Classifier: Enhances predictive accuracy by averaging multiple decision trees.
3. Correlation Analysis: Identifies the strength and direction of linear relationships between continuous variables.

## Features

1. Differnce between off-peak prices in December and preceeding January
2. Average price changes across individual periods, instead of entire year
3. Customer Tenure
4. Tenure of association with PowerCo
